This directory is for non-interactive tests.

Just run ./run_tests to run all the tests in this directory.  If the test
is successful ./run_tests will return exist status 0.

If you have valgrind installed and in your path you can edit the file
testsEnv and make most the tests run with valgrind, checking for memory
leaks.  The tests running with valgrind takes a lot more time.

Running `./run_tests` will write temporary files this directory.  Running
`make clean` will remove these temporary files.


KEEP ./run_tests RUN TIME under 5 seconds on a fast computer.


As of May 20, 2020 it runs in about 0.6 seconds with 37 tests.
