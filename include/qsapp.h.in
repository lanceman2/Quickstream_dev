/** \file
 *
 * The libquickstream application programming interface (API)
 *
 * You can link your C and C++ code with the libquickstrean library to
 * make quickstream programs that load quickstream filter modules,
 * assemble these filters into flow graphs, and run the flow graphs.
 *
 * You can do the same with the program \ref quickstream_program.
 *
 *
 * The following terms are used in function names:
 *
 * API objects
 *
 * - **Qs app**     a collection of loaded filter module plugins,
 *                  a collection of streams
 *                  an application container for all that is quickstream
 *
 * - **Qs stream**  a directed graph of filters,
 *                  a mapping of filters to threads,
 *                  a mapping of threads to processes
 *
 * - **Qs filter**  a filter module plugin from a dynamic shared object
 *                  file
 *
 * - **Qs process** an operating system process
 *
 * - **Qs thread**  an operating system thread (pthread)
