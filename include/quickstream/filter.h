 * over how the stream and it's flow behaves.  The return value 0 is the
 * most common return value telling the stream to continue flowing
 * normally.  Returning a any non-zero value stops the calling of
 * input() for the current filter and sets up the final flushing of the
 * down stream filters this the current filter is feeding.  A return value
