 *
 * The libquickstream application programming interface (API)
 *
 * You can link your C and C++ code with the libquickstrean library to
 * make quickstream programs that load quickstream filter modules,
 * assemble these filters into flow graphs, and run the flow graphs.
 *
 * You can do the most of the same thing with the program \ref
 * quickstream_program.  \ref quickstream_program with the name
 * quickstream is written with this API.
 *
 * The following terms/words are used in function names and other things:
 *
 * - **qs**     the prefix for all functions in this API.  Other
 *              programming things may have a different case like
 *              \e Qs or \e QS.
 *
 * - **app**    a collection of loaded filter module plugins,
 *              a collection of streams, and
 *              an application container for all that is quickstream
 *
 * - **stream** a directed graph of interconnected filters,
 *              a mapping of filters to threads,
 *              an interface to run the stream
 *
 * - **filter** a filter module plugin from a dynamic shared object
 *              file
 *
 * - **thread**  an operating system thread (pthread)
 *
 * - **source** \anchor source  filters are filters that do not
 *               have connections to them, but may have connections from
 *               them.  Sources are where the flow starts.
 *
 * quickstream functions that do not return an structure pointer, tend to
 * return an int with a value 0 for the common success case.  int return
 * values greater than zero tend to be common none error selective cases
 * and negative return values tend to be selective error cases.
 * Enumerations are provided to interpret them.
